The footprint on the first revision of the board was for a leadless package, but the STM32F030 that I originally planned to use did not have a QFN version. I therefore had to upgrade to an STM32F051 for testing before the board re-spin (putting a piece of Kapton under the exposed ground pad).

The project was abandoned before the second board re-spin, so the STM32F051 code is more developed.
